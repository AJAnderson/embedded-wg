# The Embedded Working Group Newsletter - 5

> 2018-05-15

This is the fifth bi-weekly newsletter of the [Embedded WG] where we highlight new progress, celebrate cool projects, thank the community, and advertise projects that need help!

If you want to mention something in [the next newsletter], make sure to leave a comment on the issue.

## Highlights

* We had a bonus Embedded-WG Newsletter this week about the [path forward] towards stable Embedded Rust, and what you can do as a crate maintainer to help with the effort!
* The Tock-OS project posted about their [MMIO Registers], contrasting them to crates generated by `svd2rust`
* It might be possible to use [regex without std dependencies], thanks to lots of help by [Zack Pierce] and others!
* There were a couple of great posts about developing with Rust on Embedded targets from [219 Design] and [nercury]
* If Game Boy Advance development with Rust sounds interesting to you, make sure you check out the [rusty-TONC] and [stdgba] projects

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* [Kjetil Kjeka] shared their crate [uX] pronounced as "unsigned X" for working with non standard integer types (like `u7`, `u63`, etc) which act like the built in unsigned integer types
* [Adam Greig] shared two crates:
    * [stm32-rs], a tool for cleaning up Chip Support Crates for STM32 microcontrollers and making it easier to work between multiple devices
    * [blethrs], an ethernet bootloader for STM32F4 chips, using the [smoltcp] networking stack
* [James Waffles] released a driver for [ssd1306] based OLED displays, read the [announcement blog] for more info
* [John Scarrott] released a Chip Support Crate for the [nRF52840] chip from Nordic Semiconductor
* [Kerem] posted a new Chip Support Crate for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF51, and joined development of the existing [nrf51-hal] HAL Impl Crate
* [Teo Röijezon] released a combo of a [stm32f0x0] Chip Support Crate, as well as a [stm32f0x0-hal] HAL Impl Crate
* [Rahul Thakoor] shipped a driver crate for [mma7660fc] based 3-axis accelerometers. Check out the [mma7660fc blog] announcement
* [whitequark] shared their [log_buffer] crate for storing UTF-8 text in a ring buffer, and accessing it as `&str`s
* [Michael] shared [proptest], a tool for performing Property Based Testing, which now has no_std support
