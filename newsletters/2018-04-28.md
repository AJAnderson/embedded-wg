# The Embedded Working Group Newsletter - 4

> 2018-04-28

This is the fourth bi-weekly newsletter of the [Embedded WG] where we highlight new progress, celebrate cool projects, thank the community, and advertise projects that need help!

If you want to mention something in [the next newsletter], make sure to leave a comment on the issue.

[the next newsletter]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/93
[Embedded WG]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg

## Highlights

* The [Embedded WG] IRC meetings are now explicitly public, and the agendas for the next meeting can be found in the [WG Issues], like [this issue] for the next meeting
* [David] shared his utility [`Form`], which takes a single `lib.rs` (like those created by `svd2rust` or `bindgen`), and splits it into structured modules. Check out the [`nrf52`] Chip Support Crate as an example, and try it out for your generated projects!
* [astro] shared [`managed`], A library that provides a way to logically own objects, whether or not heap allocation is available

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* [Daniel] started work on [`bluetooth-hci`], an abstraction layer for HCI based Bluetooth Controllers, and is using it in his [`bluenrg`] crate for STMicro's BlueNRG RF modules
* [cr1901] shared his [`AT2XT`] project, an adapter that allows use of low cost PS2 keyboards with older computers that expect (now very expensive) XT keyboards. The firmware for this project is based on `rtfm`, and runs on an `msp430` microcontroller. Check out the [short blurb] by [cr1901] summarizing the project
* [hannobraun] released v0.3 of his [`lpc82x`] Chip Support Crate for NXP's LPC82x family of microcontrollers, as well as v0.1 of [`lpc82x-hal`]. Check out the [lpc82x-hal announcement] here!
* [japaric] released v0.3.1 of [`heapless`] which now contains fixed capacity implementations of `HashMap` and `HashSet` that work on `no_std`, do not require an allocator, and use `u32` hashes (instead of the default `u64`).
