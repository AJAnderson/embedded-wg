This is the third bi-weekly newsletter of the [Embedded WG] where we highlight new progress, celebrate cool projects, thank the community, and advertise projects that need help!

If you want to mention something in [the next newsletter], make sure to leave a comment on the issue.

## Highlights

* Crates for the Embedded Rust Ecosystem are now being tracked in the [Awesome Embedded Rust] repository
* Progress has been made as part of the [Embedded Rust on Stable] initiative, including:
    * `extern crate compiler_builtins` is [now included in the no_std prelude]
    * [xargo no longer needed] for ARM Cortex-M development
    * You can now link Embedded Rust programs [using lld]
* [Wilfried] kicked off a blog series about [using embedded rust]
* [Andre Richter] is writing a tutorial for using Rust to write [bare metal Raspberry Pi 3] applications

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* [japaric] released an initial version of [cargo-binutils], which will allow you to use LLVM's binutils (like `nm`, `size`, `objcopy`, etc.) in the format `cargo objcopy` (once [issue 49584] has landed)
* [myeisha] released the first version of their [thumb2-stack-size] tool, which helps determine the maximum stack size used in embedded code

### `embedded-hal` Ecosystem Crates

As part of the [Weekly Driver Initiative], crates that are part of the `embedded-hal` ecosystem are now tracked in the [Awesome Embedded Rust] repository. Here is a current snapshot of what is available there:

| Type | Status | Count | Link |
| :--- | :----- | :---- | :--- |
| Device Crates | released | 13 | https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#device-crates |
| HAL Impl Crates | released | 10 | https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#hal-implementation-crates |
| Driver Crates | released | 7 | https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#driver-crates |
| Driver Crates | WIP | 26 | https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#wip |

## Help Wanted

* We need help working on [RFC2070], stabilizing usage of custom Panic behavior. [nagisa] is willing to mentor!
* If you use inline assembly in your Embedded Rust programs, help us capture what assembly operations are [used most often] so we can stabilize them as intrinsics

[RFC2070]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44489#issuecomment-378058031

[used most often]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/63#issue-305114817
