# Meeting agenda

- Docker Containers
   - Context: I have a HiFive1 board, but haven't managed to build the toolchain successfully on OSX
      - Not because it's bad, but because it takes a long time to build and I end up task-switching to something else and never get around to researching a fix.
   - Can we build / collect / document Docker containers for targets that require a custom Rust build?
      - https://github.com/qmx/docker-avr-rust
      - RISCV, MSP430, any others?
      - Ideally would be implemented in similar styles and with same base containers to make them easier to maintain.
      - Process for building / uploading recent builds?
   - Just rediscovered [japaric/cross] (https://github.com/japaric/cross ) which makes it easy to use rust Docker containers for cross-compilation.
      - Currently supports many targets, but seems to depend on locally installed rust - is this true?
      - If so, can it be extended to support using fully self-contained containers as described above?
I have an open PR for cross to move all of the rust internals to Docker Volumes, removing the dependency on the host env:
    https://github.com/japaric/cross/pull/131 - it probably needs some more work, it was a PoC from a few months ago.

- $YOUR_AGENDA_ITEM

# Rust All Hands

- Ship LLVM binutils with the Rust toolchain - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/50
- Test embedded targets as part of rust-lang/rust CI - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/52
- Xargo in Cargo
- Cargo project templates
- Panic handler binary size bloat - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/41
- Unblock AVR backend from landing by temporarily `cfg(not(target_arch = "avr"))`-ing away all i128 code from core
- see if we can wrangle someone with experience on how firefox integrates rust into a C++ build ecosystem
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47074 - Multiple codegen units breaks linking: "undefined reference to rust_begin_unwind"

# Action items

- add maintainers to japaric/cross
- japaric: try to get lld working for cortex-m-rt
- new issue: categorize between asm that needs to be inlined vs what can be implemented as FFI
- standard way to get started with embedded Rust
- issue: Rust embeddonomicon that explains linker script magic and other low level stuff
- issue (james) - tracking issue for "stable rust embedded"

# Minutes

We discussed

- Using container for developing for the AVR and RISCV, targets which are not yet in the compiler
- Requests to bring up to the Rust teams
  - Test embedded targets as part of rust-lang/rust CI system
  - Ship llvm-binutils with the Rust toolchain
  - Stabilization of unstable features for embedded development
    - Assembly 1.1
    - What's the minimal set of features one needs?
      - How to make a minimal no-std binaries?
      - Linker script magic used in cortex-m-rt
