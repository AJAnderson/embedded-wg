        - @nagisa will mentor
      - fix binary size issue later using pure MIR rlibs (not yet implemented)
    - Xargo
      - we'll provide rust-std components for the embedded targets
      - made PR for Cortex-M
        - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49563
      - TODO msp430 (tier 2) -- compiler errors shouldn't block PR from landing
    - compiler-builtins
      - PR to add extern crate compiler_builtins to #![no_std] expansion
        - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49503
    - const-fn
      - proposed for stabilization
        - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111#issuecomment-376605402
    - #[used]
      - RFC for stabilization
        - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2386

  - tests in rust-lang/rust CI
     - Cortex-M will be tier 1
       - tier 1: rust-std component, has tests and test errors block PRs from landing
     - others will be tier 2/3 depending on the state of the llvm backend
       - tier 2: like tier 1 but tests don't block PRs from landing, rust-std component may be missing sometimes
       - tier 3: no tests or rust-std component
     - adding tests will be the Increasing Rust Reach project
       - http://reach.rust-lang.org/

  - llvm-binutils
    - discussion issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49584

  - cargo-size, et al.
    - first step: just directly expose the underlying tool (has to search for it in the sysroot first)

  - website
    - made a wireframe during Rust All Hands
