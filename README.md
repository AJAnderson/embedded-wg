This is the rust-embedded RFC (Request For Comment) repository. The purpose
of this repository is to help Rust become a great language and ecosystem for
embedded projects.

This repository exists to help facilitate that goal by providing an RFC process
to design the ecosystem we wish to see. The RFC processs has worked well for
rust and we expect it will work well for us as well. Learn more about the Rust's
RFC process (which is the same as our own) [here][1].

To create an RFC, simply:
- clone this repo to your own personal one
- copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is
  descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet)
- fill in the details of your RFC in that file
- Open an pull request with this repository

We hope that by having community involvement and dicussion, we can mobilize
and collaborate on efforts to make rust's embedded ecosystem more productive
and fun.

This repository is an attempt at mobilizing efforts towards that goal and we are currently
discussing the scope and contents of this repository.
